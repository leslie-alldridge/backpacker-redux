# Ever gone on a holiday or flight and discovered something you thought was packed, never was?

## Goals

My goals are to create a web app where you can track bags and belongings, and dive in deeper with a checklist to ensure everything is packed & received.

## Technical Stack requirements

This web app should use React and Redux as a minimum.

### MVP - Achieved

1. As a user I want to save my onboard and checked in bags with an itemized list of what's inside - Done
2. As a user I would like to tick off my items as I go through my bag - Done
3. Users will prefer a simplistic design where they can add, edit, update or delete bags - Done

### Stretch Goals

1. Ability to edit and delete items within a bag (MVP is edit + delete for bags themselves). EDIT: Delete works but edit doesn't seem like an essential piece of functionality. Will ask some colleagues for their opinion. Decided against Edit. - Done
2. Login and Database for persistent storage and privacy - Done
3. Mobile friendly - Done

## Reflections

Reflecting at the end of day two. I really enjoyed learning all of the CRUD actions in Redux and saving the state to local storage. Next week I'll aim to incorporate login and database on this application and deploy it to Heroku. I learned a lot from this project and also pitched it to be created during weeks 2 and 3 of bootcamp. Sadly other people didn't seem to bond with the idea of leaving stuff behind on holiday, so I set out to make my idea a reality this weekend. I've conducted user testing with my colleagues and they identified some bugs and difficult to understand button names I didn't notice at the time, which were rectified as a result. This highlighted the importance that user testing has.

## Further Reflections

We later learned authentication and that was the last piece of our full stack puzzle. I hurried off to incorporate login, internal API's and database queries into this application. Throughout this process I encountered many issues and worked through them one by one. The quantity of commits made me realise that full stack applications are big projects but also the most rewarding. I'm please with the outcome, both learnings and the product itself. I've introduced the idea to people and they've responded positively. The application is mobile friendly and deployed on Heroku.

## Intentions

To put my new learnings to a test as part of my personal revision of Week 6 at Enspiral Dev Academy.
