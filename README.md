# Ever gone on a holiday or flight and discovered something you thought was packed, never was?

## Goals

My goals are to create a web app where you can track bags and belongings, and dive in deeper with a checklist to ensure everything is packed & received.

## Technical Stack requirements

This web app should use React and Redux as a minimum.

### MVP

1. As a user I want to save my onboard and checked in bags with an itemized list of what's inside - Done
2. As a user I would like to tick off my items as I go through my bag - Done
3. Users will prefer a simplistic design where they can add, edit, update or delete bags - Done

### Stretch Goals

1. Ability to edit and delete items within a bag (MVP is edit + delete for bags themselves). EDIT: Delete works but edit doesn't seem like an essential piece of functionality. Will ask some colleagues for their opinion.
2. Login and Database for persistent storage and privacy
3. Courtesy email to say thanks for signing up

## Reflections

TBA

## Intentions

To put my new learnings to a test as part of my personal revision of Week 6 at Enspiral Dev Academy.
